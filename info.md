## How Does Ruby for Good Work?

The organizers of Ruby for Good work year round contacting and working with non-profits to find projects that are both in the mission of Ruby for Good and achievable.

During registration we ask registrants if they are interested in leading a team during the event.

We'll have the team leads picked out approximately 1-2 months before the event from starts and we will let them know about the project as well as put them in contact with the non-profits that we are going to be working with. From there the team lead will speak to the non-profit, get program requirements and do some initial setup. This setup includes things like making a github repo, filing some issues and also making some technology suggestions. One of the team leads in a prior year, [Brandon](http://www.blrice.net/blog/2015/08/10/leading-a-team-at-ruby-for-good/), wrote an amazing post detailing the experience of leading a team.

On the first day of Ruby for Good, the team leads will make a "pitch" to the attendees about their project and any specific skill sets they'd love on their team. This is an event for people of *all* skill levels so even if you are new, don't let that prevent you from contributing! The attendees self select into projects that are meaningful to them and the fun begins!
