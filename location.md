##Getting here:

###Car:

If you are driving, the address is:

4400 University Dr.
Fairfax, VA 22030

###Bus:

If you are coming to DC via greyhound/megabus/etc it is likely that they will drop you off at Union Station. From Union Station you'll want to get on the Metro (there is a metro station at Union Station), ride the metro to the Metro Center stop, transfer to the Orange Line and then take the Orange Line to the Vienna Metro stop.

###Plane:

If you are flying to National (DCA), take the Metro blue line to Rosslyn, transfer to the Orange line and ride it to the Vienna Metro stop.

If you are flying to Dulles (IAD), take the silver line express. Get on the silver line, transfer to the Orange line at West Falls Church and then ride the orange line to the Vienna metro stop.

###Bus and Plane:

At the Vienna Metro stop leave through the North exit (turn left when you have to choose an exit) and then go to the GMU shuttle stop. The shuttle is free and you need to get off at the first stop on campus. You'll be able to see a Starbucks from the shuttle. The residences are directly behind the Starbucks, and just walk to the the one that has a giant sign out front that says Hampton Roads. In the map below the area circled in red shows where you get off the shuttle and the area in green shows the building you'll head to.
